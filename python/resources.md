# A list of resources for python

 * [MIT OCW 6.00SC] A free archived course from MIT complete with dozens of video lectures. This is how I (Josie) learned python and computer science. I highly recommend it if you have the time. (Although it uses Python 2.7, and we'll be using Python 3.6)
 * [Think Python]: A free online book that goes a lot more in depth than what you might find at a place like codeacademy, while remaining relatively simple and very easy to follow.
 * [Learn Python the Hard Way]: This book isn't free but I think I like it more than Think Python, and it's relatively cheap. It also has a really great tutorial for using the command line.
